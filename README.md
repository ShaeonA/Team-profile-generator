# Team-profille-generator  
This assignment required me to utilize inquirer as well as the file system module(s) within node.js , I was instructed to conduct a 
command line app which can take in information about employees and then generate that info onto an HTML page, as well as constructing tests for each part of my code to validate that it passes/ or is functioning .
